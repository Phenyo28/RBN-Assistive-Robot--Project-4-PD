🤖 AutoNav Robot — User Manual

Version: v1.0
Date: October 2025

1. Introduction

The AutoNav Robot is an autonomous mobile system designed to navigate and avoid obstacles using ultrasonic sensors. It integrates two microcontrollers:

ESP32 (Main Controller) – Manages sensors, LED indicators, and Wi-Fi communication.

Arduino Mega 2560 (Secondary Controller) – Executes motor commands through the L298N driver.

The robot can move forward, detect obstacles, stop, and automatically reroute based on sensor input. LED indicators provide real-time feedback on system status.

This project demonstrates the integration of mechanical design, electronics, and embedded programming into a unified platform for robotics learning, research, and prototyping.

⚠️ Safety Note:
Operate only on flat, dry surfaces. Avoid water, dust, and heat. Check wiring before powering on, and disconnect the battery when not in use.

2. Package Contents

1 × AutoNav Robot (Fully Assembled)
Includes chassis, wheels, motors, sensors, motor driver, ESP32, and Arduino Mega 2560.

1 × Rechargeable Battery Pack (4 × 18650 cells pre-installed)

1 × USB Cable (for programming updates)

1 × Mobile App (download link / QR code)

1 × User Manual

3. Operating Instructions

Turn ON the power switch.

Place the robot on a flat surface.

The robot moves forward until an obstacle is detected.

When an obstacle is detected, it turns in the opposite direction.

LEDs display live status indicators.

The mobile app can be used for manual control.

4. Modes of Operation
1️⃣ Autonomous Mode

Uses ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection.

Automatically moves, stops, and turns as needed.

LED Indicators:

🟢 Green – Moving forward

🟡 Yellow – Turning / obstacle detected

🔴 Red – Stopped

2️⃣ Manual Remote Mode

Controlled via mobile app (Bluetooth).

Commands: Forward, Backward, Stop, Left, Right.

Speed adjustable via PWM.

LEDs still provide status feedback.

3️⃣ Standby / Idle Mode

Motors off, system powered.

🔴 Red LED indicates standby.

5. Software Overview

The robot uses two synchronized programs — one for the ESP32 and one for the Arduino Mega 2560.

ESP32 (Main Controller):

Manages ultrasonic sensors and LEDs.

Reads distance and makes navigation decisions.

Sends serial commands to Mega.

Handles app communication over Wi-Fi.

Arduino Mega 2560 (Motor Controller):

Receives commands from ESP32.

Controls motor direction and speed via L298N driver.

Executes forward, reverse, turn, and stop commands.

6. Obstacle Avoidance

How It Works:

Ultrasonic sensors measure distance continuously.

If an obstacle is detected (10–20 cm), the robot stops and turns.

Resumes movement once the path is clear.

Tips:

Use indoors on smooth surfaces.

Keep sensors clean.

Avoid sunlight or reflective surfaces.

Limitations:

May not detect transparent or very thin objects.

Accuracy decreases on uneven terrain.

7. Controls
Manual Control

Power Switch – Turns the robot on/off.

App Buttons – Move Forward / Backward / Left / Right / Stop.

Autonomous Mode

Robot moves independently.

Stops, turns, and continues automatically.

LED Indicators

🟢 Green – Active / Moving

🔵 Blue – Manual Mode

🔴 Red – Stopped / Obstacle Detected

8. Battery Management
A) Installing

Switch robot OFF.

Open battery compartment.

Insert 18650 cells (check polarity).

Close securely.

B) Charging

Use an external Li-ion 18650 charger.

Follow polarity markings carefully.

C) Safety Tips

Use only quality cells with protection circuits.

Don’t mix old/new or different brands.

Avoid heat (> 60 °C), water, or fire.

Replace any swollen or damaged cells.

D) Battery Life

Recharge before full discharge.

Store at 40–60 % charge if unused for long periods.

Keep in a cool, dry place.
